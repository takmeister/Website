<center><p style="margin: 10px 20px; text-align:left;">What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, heretic scum? I'll have you know I was brainwashed the best among the group of stalkers I was captured with, and I have over 300 confirmed kills of non-believers wishing to get past Pripyat. I am trained in hunting dissidents, and I'm the top sniper in my entire brotherhood. You are nothing to me but just another agitator of the great Monolith. I will cleanse you with the holy power bestowed upon me the likes of which has never been seen before in this Zone, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with your blasphemy outside of Monolith territory? Think again, heretic. As we speak I am praying to the great Monolith. Your PDAs are being traced right now, so you had better prepare for the blowout, pagan. The blowout will cleanse the Zone of its intruders and non-believers. You will die, stalker. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my Gauss rifle. Not only am I extensively trained in close combat, but I channel the powers of the great Monolith and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your pathetic soul off the face of the zone, you heretic. If only you could have known what suffering and strife your blasphemy was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your artifacts in their containers and not in your hand. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you will be purged for your actions. Bullets from the glorious Monolith will rain down from the skies on your pathetic, empty skull. You shall be cleansed, stalker.</p></center>
